## 🖼️ How to Find Images (Free, Legal, Sri Lanka-relevant)

### ✅ 1. **Free Image Libraries (Creative Commons / Royalty-Free)**

| Platform            | Filter Tips                              | Link                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Unsplash**        | Search: `Sri Lanka`, `hospital`, `clinic`, `family` | [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com) |
| **Pexels**          | Good for health and people images         | [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com) |
| **Pixabay**         | Also supports SVG/illustrations           | [pixabay.com](https://pixabay.com) |
| **Freepik**         | Great for flat illustrations, with filters | [freepik.com](https://www.freepik.com) |
| **Rawpixel**        | Quality ethnic/cultural content           | [rawpixel.com](https://www.rawpixel.com) |

📌 **Tip**: On these platforms, try combinations like:
- `Sri Lanka patient`
- `Sri Lankan doctor`
- `asian family medical`

> You can always **localize Western-style health visuals** by pairing with **Sri Lankan names, icons, or captions**.
