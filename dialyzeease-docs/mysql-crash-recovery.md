Thanks for sharing the `C:\xampp-8.2.0\mysql\datamysql_error.log`. The issue is very clear now:

---

### ❌ Critical Errors
1. `Aria recovery failed` — corrupted **Aria tables**.
2. `Plugin 'Aria' registration as a STORAGE ENGINE failed` — means **MySQL can't start**.
3. `Could not open mysql.plugin table` — plugin table missing/corrupt due to previous crash.

---

### ✅ Fix Instructions (Safe Recovery)

#### ⚠️ Step 0: **Backup First**
Before doing anything, make a **full backup**:
```plaintext
C:\xampp-8.2.0\mysql\data\
```

---

### 🛠 Step 1: **Delete `aria_log` Files**
Go to:
```plaintext
C:\xampp-8.2.0\mysql\data\
```

Delete all these (don't worry, they're re-generated):
```
aria_log_control
aria_log.00000001
aria_log.00000002
...
```

---

### 🛠 Step 2: **Run Aria Recovery Manually (Optional)**
If you want to try recovering your **Aria tables**, run this in CMD:

```bash
cd C:\xampp-8.2.0\mysql\bin
aria_chk -r "C:\xampp-8.2.0\mysql\data\mysql\*.MAI"
```

> If that fails, it's safer to let MySQL recreate the corrupt metadata (next step).

---

### 🧹 Step 3: **Repair or Rebuild Corrupt MySQL System Tables**

If you **don't need existing data** (clean reset):
1. Stop MySQL in XAMPP.
2. Rename:
   ```
   C:\xampp-8.2.0\mysql\data\ → data_broken
   ```
3. Copy:
   ```
   C:\xampp-8.2.0\mysql\backup\ → C:\xampp-8.2.0\mysql\data\
   ```

Then:
- Start MySQL in XAMPP → it should work now.

---

### 🔄 Alternative: Replace Only `mysql` Subfolder

If you want to preserve **your databases**, but reset the system tables:
1. Go to:
   ```
   C:\xampp-8.2.0\mysql\data\
   ```
2. Rename:
   ```
   mysql → mysql_broken
   ```
3. Copy `C:\xampp-8.2.0\mysql\backup\mysql\` → into `data\mysql`

Then restart MySQL.

---

### ✅ Final Cleanup
If MySQL starts fine:
- Recheck your custom databases.
- Recreate users if necessary via `phpMyAdmin` or MySQL CLI.

Let me know if you:
- Want to recover specific `.frm`/.ibd`/`.MYD` files.
- Still get errors after the above steps.

I can help you fully recover or migrate old DBs if needed.
